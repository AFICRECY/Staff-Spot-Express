A healthy company culture can be fostered through the use of effective employee database software. The use of effective employee database software can lead to improved employee engagement and decreased workplace frustration. This is due to the instant, secure, and controlled access employees have to their own records. Proper maintenance of these records also contributes to greater data security, as the software builds a strong system that prevents the misuse of information. Moreover, employee database software enables companies to establish a well-defined organizational structure through the inclusion of custom entities. Businesses can tailor their workforce according to their specific needs and remain current with compliance updates.

This application brings together different kinds of software and associated packages to create an employee database called Staff Spot Express. Staff Spot Express allows the user to, through the command line, enter “node server.js”, and have access to their company departments in table format, an employee list in table format, employee roles, salary amounts, as well as providing the employees supervisor. Not only can the user have access to this information, they are able to easily add an employee, add a role, add a department, and update an employee/role. Once the user enters the initiating commands to their terminal, they have access to their company database.
